                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>Why the Web? Because unlike any other technology, the Web can be whatever we make it. We can shape it. We can mold it. But most importantly, we can use it to connect every single person on Earth, giving people the ability, as users and contributors, to improve their lives and communities.</p>

				<h3>Benefits of a Web based portal</h3>
	        	<p><b>Localization:</b> Media such as newspapers, radio and TV report information relevant to a relatively large geographical region: a district, a country, etc.  It is more difficult to find localized information, at the community level. With the Web, a village, independent of its size, and any community (even one that is separated geographically) can share information relevant to their members and citizens wherever Web access is possible.</p>
	        	<p><b>Universality:</b> Radio, TV, and newspapers usually cover a relatively large geographic area, and they are typically available only to people living in that area. It is difficult for people outside of the area to access those media. The Web is universal, and available anywhere in the World where people have access to it. This allows people today to, for example, book a hotel and prepare vacations on the other side of the planet.</p>
	        	<p><b>Focus:</b> Localization and scope of media mentioned above concerned geographical aspects. This is also true for thematic aspects. There are today millions of communities specialized on specific themes (languages, hobby, nature,â€¦). While there are thematic radio, newspaper, TV, and magazines, their diffusion is geographically limited, while these communities are spread over the Web. The Web, by connecting people, enables those with shared interests to exchange their resources independently of their respective locations.</p>
	        	<p><b>Search:</b> Mechanisms such as libraries, guides, reviews and word-of-mouth, can help people to find information they seek in traditional media.  On the Web, search engines, as well as easier access to guides and reviews, facilitate the quest for information.  The volume of information on the Web and the ability to assess the quality of information are issues requiring further work.</p>
	        	<p><b>Linking:</b>  A person can change channels on the radio or TV, or pickup one newspaper and then move to another.  On the Web, links allow people to move easily from one Web page to related information elsewhere on the same page, on the same site or one a different site halfway around the world.  The emergence of the Semantic Web promises to extend this capability to linking data and ascribing greater meaning to data and relationships across the Web.</p>
