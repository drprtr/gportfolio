                        <h4>Project Management</h4>
                        <p>I am an advocate of agile project development methods and currently use the Scrum Methodology with my team</p>
                        <p>Scrum is an agile process most commonly used for product development, especially software development.
                          Scrum is a project management framework that is applicable to any project with aggressive deadlines, complex requirements and a degree of uniqueness.
                          In Scrum, projects move forward via a series of iterations called sprints. A sprint period represents a specific outcome from any part of the project, rather than treating the project as a series of sequential milestones.</p>
                          <p>At the end of each sprint, the team produces a potentially shippable product increment â€” i.e. working, high-quality software. Each day during the sprint, team members meet to discuss their progress and any impediments to completing the work for that sprint. This is known as the daily scrum, hence the name.</p>
                        <p>In Scrum, a team is cross functional, meaning everyone is needed to take a feature from idea to implementation. This leads to highly skilled teams with each member having a broad skillbase to allow them to adapt to the project requirements. Directing and supporting the development of the team members is essential for the organisation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-two">
                        <h4>Version Control</h4>
                        <p>A Version Control system allows a development team to easily manage a software development project.
                        It provides tools to track and control changes to files to allow several developers to work on the same project. 
                        A system such as Git also provides bug tracking, issue reporting and task management tools.</p>
                        <p>The ability to track changes promotes accountability and makes it easier to find the right person to solve problems in the materials maintained.
                        A list of exact changes made can be generated quickly and easily, making it easier to advise users of the information on how it has changed from version to version.
                        It is easy to 'roll back' to an earlier version of the information, if a serious mistake was made during a change.</p>
                        <p>Other benefits include
                            <ul>
                                <li>Integrated issue tracking, lets you stay on top of bugs and focus on features.</li>
                                <li>Accountability and performance review for team members</li>
                                <li>Collaborative code review - speeds up bug smashing and problem solving</li>
                                <li>Version tracking and branching - test multiple solutions simultaneously</li>
                                <li>Rapid Deployment (and reversion)</li>
                                <li>Automatic backups</li>
                                <li>Provides one method for an entire team to use; everybody operates under the same 'ground rules'.</li>
                                <li>Changes are orderly vs. chaotic, saving development time.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h4>Managing Client Expectations</h4>
                        <p>The key principles I use for managing expectations</p>
                        <ul>
	                        <li><strong>Be Honest From The Get-Go.</strong>  As with most things in life, there are too many factors at play to make any grandiose promises. Helping the client to understand the project tempers their expectations and keeps them involved inthe development cycle. The client will never feel that you are hiding anything from them or short-changing them in terms of your commitment.
	                        </li>
	                        <li><strong>Under-Promise , Over-Deliver.</strong> Agree clear requirements for the project that meet the minimum expectations of the client. Any extras that emerge during the development cycle will be seen as adding value.
	                        </li>
	                        <li><strong>Anticipate the Clientâ€™s Needs Before They Know Their Own Need.</strong> Keep up to date with the business environment and emerging trends, be able to talk to the client about what other actors are doing to help them plan their project. This reduces the amount of 'feature creep' during development.
	                        </li>
	                        <li><strong>Constant Communication.</strong>  I can recognise when things are going great and when we need to ramp up our efforts. Itâ€™s important to share that with a client. Hopefully just knowing youâ€™re available and ready to jump on a project as needed will be enough so that your clientâ€™s wonâ€™t abuse your generosity with time.
	                        </li>
	                        <li><strong>Reports.</strong> Reports donâ€™t have to be very long, or in a format that clogs up a lot of your time. A simple email detailing tasks completed for the week shows your clients what theyâ€™re paying for, and thus, keeps them happy.
	                        </li>

                        <p>All subjects at Walbottle have their own web based learning space. Making resources available online through the cloud at any time and any place means that the learning environment is extended beyond the classroom. </p>

                        <p>Rewarding students' achievements is fundamental to the ethic of excellence at Walbottle Campus. A system was needed to manage rewards claimed by students. Teachers can easily access their class lists and allocate rewards points against criteria with a single click. Students can access the Rewards Shop to cash in their points and collect their rewards from their Year Leader.</p>

                        <p>The school reports project reduces administration and teacher time for writing and printing reports. By importing attainment data from our MIS and combining it with teacher written reports we have reduced the time taken to complie, check and print students reports to be sent to parents.</p>
