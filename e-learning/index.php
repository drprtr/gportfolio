                <h4>The Main Thing</h4>
                <p>Sudents develop a digital portfolio (DP) that provides a comprehensive look at their work, learning and projects. Students update their digital portfolios regularly, documenting their learning over time. Digital portfolios are a way of showcasing student achievement through class assignments, community service, and occupational experience. By encouraging our students to publish their own content, we are supporting the development of their digital literacy and citizenship.</p>

                <h4>Stimulating Curiosity</h4>
                <p>As any Head of Department knows well, one of the most challenging and important things to do is to raise the profile of your subject or department, especially if it’s an option subject from early on. The cloud can play an important role in this thanks to the fact that we are not limited to curriculum content and we can begin to imagine ways in which we use the cloud to pique our students’ curiosity about our subjects.</p>

                <h4>Personalisation</h4>
                <p>Building student profiles based around their data, attainment and learning styles enables us to personalise their learning experience to a great degree. This leads to greater engagement of students in their learning which in turn leads to higher attainment. Collecting and storing this data in one place makes it easier for teaching and pastoral staff to get an overall picture of each student when having learning conversations, writing reports or addressing pastoral issues.</p>
